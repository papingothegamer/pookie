      <p>
        I have not been at my best behavior and I have not given you the love you deserve by my actions.
        I am not being good to you, and it piled up only to come down yesterday in the form of you telling me you would leave.
        My stubbornness nearly cost me the one good thing I have in my life, and I am disappointed in myself for failing you.
        There are not enough words I can use to apologize or appease you, so I will let my hands and mind make you a happier woman than you were yesterday.
        I want to see many more Decembers with you and spoil you, treat you right physically and emotionally because you deserve it above everything else.
        You deserve a love that doesn't make you scared or wary or angry with yourself for pouring back into it.
        I am sincerely sorry for not being the husband you always needed me to be.
        I was selfish, and it nearly cost me our bond.
        I have owned up to my faults, I will do my humanly possible best to amend them and fix us, and I will personally embark on a journey to find peace with myself so that the peace you give me would be a lot more beautiful.
        I am sorry, my love.
        I look forward to a brighter future with you as my wife and best friend, and together we'll have the beauty of a life we have dreamed of and brought to reality.
        
        I love you, always.
        
         - Your husband, lover, and friend.
